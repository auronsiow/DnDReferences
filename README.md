# Dungeons and Dragons Class Reference

The purpose of this project is to give new players a quick introduction of the class types in DnD. Relevant data of each class type is pulled from [D&D 5e API](http://www.dnd5eapi.co/) using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). This single page, mobile-responsive, web application is developed using React and styled with Bootstrap.
